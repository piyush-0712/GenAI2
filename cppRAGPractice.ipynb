      "The C++ programming language provides a model of memory and computation that closely matches that of most computers. In addition, it provides powerful and flexible mechanisms for abstraction; that is, language constructs that allow the programmer to introduce and use new types of objects that match the concepts of an application. Thus, C++ supports styles of programming that rely on fairly direct manipulation of hardware resources to deliver a high degree of efficiency plus higher-level styles of programming that rely on user-defined types to provide a model of data and computation that is closer to a human’s view of the task being performed by a computer. These higher-level styles of programming are often called data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and generic programming.\n",
      "C++ History\n",
      "In the early 1980's, also at Bell Laboratories, another programming language was created which was based upon the C language.This new language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup and was called C++.  According to Stroustrup, the purpose of C++ is to make writing good programs easier and more pleasant for the individual programmer.When he designed C++, he added OOP (Object Oriented Programming) features to C without significantly changing the C component. Thus C++ is a \"relative\" of C, meaning that any valid C program is also a valid C++ program.\n",

      "What is C++?\n",
      "Ans : Released in 1985, C++ is an object-oriented programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ maintains almost all aspects of the C language, while simplifying memory management and adding several features - including a new datatype known as a class (you will learn more about these later) - to allow object-oriented programming. C++ maintains the features of C which allowed for low-level memory access but also gives the programmer new tools to simplify memory management. \n",
      "C++ used for:\n",
      "C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to create small programs or large applications. It can be used to make CGI scripts or console-only DOS programs. C++ allows you to create programs to do almost anything you need to do. The creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, has put together a partial list of applications written in C++.\n",
      " \n",
      "How do you find out if a linked-list has an end? (i.e. the list is not a cycle) \n",
      "Ans : You can find out by using 2 pointers. One of them goes 2 nodes each time. The second one goes at 1 nodes each time. If there is a cycle, the one that goes 2 nodes each time will eventually meet the one that goes slower. If that is the case, then you will know the linked-list is a cycle.\n",
      " \n",
      "What is the difference between realloc() and free()? \n",
      "Ans : The free subroutine frees a block of memory previously allocated by the malloc subroutine. Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a valid pointer. If the Pointer parameter is a null value, no action will occur. The realloc subroutine changes the size of the block of memory pointed to by the Pointer parameter to the number of bytes specified by the Size parameter and returns a new pointer to the block. The pointer specified by the Pointer parameter must have been created with the malloc, calloc, or realloc subroutines and not been deallocated with the free or realloc subroutines. Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a valid pointer.\n",
      " \n",
      "Base class has some virtual method and derived class has a method with the same name. If we initialize the base class pointer with derived object, calling of that virtual method will result in which method being called?  \n",
      "Ans :\n",
      "a. Base method \n",
      "b. Derived method\n",
      "Ans. B\n",
      " \n",
      "What is function overloading and operator overloading?\n",
      "Ans : Function overloading: C++ enables several functions of the same name to be defined, as long as these functions have different sets of parameters (at least as far as their types are concerned). This capability is called function overloading. When an overloaded function is called, the C++ compiler selects the proper function by examining the number, types and order of the arguments in the call. Function overloading is commonly used to create several functions of the same name that perform similar tasks but on different data types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operator overloading allows existing C++ operators to be redefined so that they work on objects of user-defined classes. Overloaded operators are syntactic sugar for equivalent function calls. They form a pleasant facade that doesn't add anything fundamental to the language (but they can improve understandability and reduce maintenance costs).\n",
      "What are the advantages of inheritance? \n",
      "Ans : It permits code reusability. Reusability saves time in program development. It encourages the reuse of proven and debugged high-quality software, thus reducing problem after a system becomes functional.\n",
      " \n",
      "What is the difference between declaration and definition? \n",
      "Ans : The declaration tells the compiler that at some later point we plan to present the definition of this declaration.\n",
      "E.g.: void stars () //function declaration \n",
      "The definition contains the actual implementation.\n",
      "E.g.: void stars () // declarator\n",

      "What do you mean by inline function?\n",
      "Ans : The idea behind inline functions is to insert the code of a called function at the point where the function is called. If done carefully, this can improve the application's performance in exchange for increased compile time and possibly (but not always) an increase in the size of the generated binary executables.\n",

      "Ans : Public, protected and private are three access specifier in C++.\n",
      "Public data members and member functions are accessible outside the class.\n",
      "Protected data members and member functions are only available to derived classes.\n",
      "Private data members and member functions can’t be accessed outside the class. However there is an exception can be using friend classes.\n",

      "OK, why does this work?\n",
      "If a list is circular, at some point pointer2 will wrap around and be either at the item just before pointer1, or the item before that. Either way, it’s either 1 or 2 jumps until they meet.\n",

      "What is virtual constructors/destructors?\n",
      "Ans : Virtual destructors:If an object (with a non-virtual destructor) is destroyed explicitly by applying the delete operator to a base-class pointer to the object, the base-class destructor function (matching the pointer type) is called on the object.\n",
      "There is a simple solution to this problem declare a virtual base-class destructor. This makes all derived-class destructors virtual even though they don’t have the same name as the base-class destructor. Now, if the object in the hierarchy is destroyed explicitly by applying the delete operator to a base-class pointer to a derived-class object, the destructor for the appropriate class is called.

      "19. What is a template?\n",
      "Ans : Templates allow to create generic functions that admit any data type as parameters and return value without having to overload the function with all the possible data types. Until certain point they fulfill the functionality of a macro. Its prototype is any of the two following ones:\n",
      "template <class indetifier> function_declaration; template <typename indetifier> function_declaration;\n",

      "20. Define a constructor - What it is and how it might be called (2 methods).\n",
      "Ans : Constructor is a member function of the class, with the name of the function being the same as the class name. It also specifies how the object should be initialized.\n",
      "Ways of calling constructor:\n",
      "1) Implicitly: automatically by complier when an object is created.\n",
      "2) Calling the constructors explicitly is possible, but it makes the code unverifiable.\n",

      "You have two pairs: new() and delete() and another pair : alloc() and free().\n",
      " \n",
      "21.  Explain differences between eg. new() and malloc()\n",
      "Ans : 1.) “new and delete” are preprocessors while “malloc() and free()” are functions. [we dont use brackets will calling new or delete].\n",
      "2.) no need of allocate the memory while using “new” but in “malloc()” we have to use “sizeof()”.\n",
      "3.) “new” will initlize the new memory to 0 but “malloc()” gives random value in the new alloted memory location [better to use calloc()]\n",
      "new() allocates continous space for the object instace malloc() allocates distributed space.\n",
      "new() is castless, meaning that allocates memory for this specific type,\n",
      "malloc(), calloc() allocate space for void * that is cated to the specific class type pointer. \n",
      "22. What is the difference between class and structure?\n",
      "Structure: Initially (in C) a structure was used to bundle different type of data types together to perform a particular functionality. But C++ extended the structure to contain functions also. The major difference is that all declarations inside a structure are by default public.\n",
      "Class: Class is a successor of Structure. By default all the members inside the class are private.\n",
      " \n",
      "23. What is RTTI?\n",
      "Ans : Runtime type identification (RTTI) lets you find the dynamic type of an object when you have only a pointer or a reference to the base type. RTTI is the official way in standard C++ to discover the type of an object and to convert the type of a pointer or reference (that is, dynamic typing).\n",

      "30. What is namespace?\n",
      "Ans : Namespaces allow us to group a set of global classes, objects and/or functions under a name. To say it somehow, they serve to split the global scope in sub-scopes known as namespaces.\n",
      "The form to use namespaces is:\n",
      "namespace identifier { namespace-body }\n",
      "Where identifier is any valid identifier and namespace-body is the set of classes, objects and functions that are included within the namespace. For example:\n",
      "namespace general { int a, b; } In this case, a and b are normal variables integrated within the general namespace. In order to access to these variables from outside the namespace we have to use the scope operator ::. For example, to access the previous variables we would have to put:\n",

      "Ans : Friend classes are used when two or more classes are designed to work together and need access to each other's implementation in ways that the rest of the world shouldn't be allowed to have. In other words, they help keep private things private. For instance, it may be desirable for class DatabaseCursor to have more privilege to the internals of class Database than main() has.\n",

      " \n",
      "37. What is the difference between an object and a class?\n",
      "Ans : Classes and objects are separate but related concepts. Every object belongs to a class and every class contains one or more related objects.\n",
      "- A Class is static. All of the attributes of a class are fixed before, during, and after the execution of a program. The attributes of a class don't change.\n",
      "- The class to which an object belongs is also (usually) static. If a particular object belongs to a certain class at the time that it is created then it almost certainly will still belong to that class right up until the time that it is destroyed.\n",
      "- An Object on the other hand has a limited lifespan. Objects are created and eventually destroyed. Also during that lifetime, the attributes of the object may undergo significant change.\n",
      " \n",
      "38. What is a class?\n",
      "Ans : Class is a user-defined data type in C++. It can be created to solve a particular kind of problem. After creation the user need not know the specifics of the working of a class.\n",
      " \n",
      "39. What is friend function?\n",
      "Ans : As the name suggests, the function acts as a friend to a class. As a friend of a class, it can access its private and protected members. A friend function is not a member of the class. But it must be listed in the class definition.\n",
      " \n",
      "40. Which recursive sorting technique always makes recursive calls to sort subarrays that are about half size of the original array?\n",
      "Ans : Mergesort always makes recursive calls to sort subarrays that are about half size of the original array, resulting in O(n log n) time.\n",
      " \n",
      "41. What is abstraction?\n",
      "Ans : Abstraction is of the process of hiding unwanted details from the user.\n",
      " \n",
      "42. What are virtual functions?\n",
      "Ans : A virtual function allows derived classes to replace the implementation provided by the base class. The compiler makes sure the replacement is always called whenever the object in question is actually of the derived class, even if the object is accessed by a base pointer rather than a derived pointer. This allows algorithms in the base class to be replaced in the derived class, even if users don't know about the derived class.\n",
      " \n",
      "43.What is the difference between an external iterator and an internal iterator? Describe an advantage of an external iterator.\n",
      "Ans : An internal iterator is implemented with member functions of the class that has items to step through. .An external iterator is implemented as a separate class that can be \"attach\" to the object that has items to step through. .An external iterator has the advantage that many difference iterators can be active simultaneously on the same object.\n",
      " \n",
      "44. What is a scope resolution operator?\n",
      "Ans : A scope resolution operator (::), can be used to define the member functions of a class outside the class.\n",
      " \n",
      "45. What do you mean by pure virtual functions?\n",
      "Ans : A pure virtual member function is a member function that the base class forces derived classes to provide. Normally these member functions have no implementation. Pure virtual functions are equated to zero.\n",
      "class Shape { public: virtual void draw() = 0; };\n",
      " \n",
      "46. What is polymorphism? Explain with an example?\n",
      "Ans : \"Poly\" means \"many\" and \"morph\" means \"form\". Polymorphism is the ability of an object (or reference) to assume (be replaced by) or become many different forms of object.\n",
      "Example: function overloading, function overriding, virtual functions. Another example can be a plus ‘+’ sign, used for adding two integers or for using it to concatenate two strings.\n",

      " \n",
      "48. Why arrays are usually processed with for loop?\n",
      "Ans : The real power of arrays comes from their facility of using an index variable to traverse the array, accessing each element with the same expression a[i]. All the is needed to make this work is a iterated statement in which the variable i serves as a counter, incrementing from 0 to a.length -1. That is exactly what a loop does.\n",
      " \n",
      "49. What is an HTML tag?\n",
      "Ans : An HTML tag is a syntactical construct in the HTML language that abbreviates specific instructions to be executed when the HTML script is loaded into a Web browser. It is like a method in Java, a function in C++, a procedure in Pascal, or a subroutine in FORTRAN.\n",

      "delete p;\n",
      "Yes, the program will crash in an attempt to delete a null pointer.\n",
      " \n",
      "54. How do you decide which integer type to use?\n",
      "Ans : It depends on our requirement. When we are required an integer to be stored in 1 byte (means less than or equal to 255) we use short int, for 2 bytes we use int, for 8 bytes we use long int.\n",
      "A char is for 1-byte integers, a short is for 2-byte integers, an int is generally a 2-byte or 4-byte integer (though not necessarily), a long is a 4-byte integer, and a long long is a 8-byte integer.\n",
      " \n",
      "55. What does extern mean in a function declaration?\n",
      "Ans : Using extern in a function declaration we can make a function such that it can used outside the file in which it is defined.\n",
      "An extern variable, function definition, or declaration also makes the described variable or function usable by the succeeding part of the current source file. This declaration does not replace the definition. The declaration is used to describe the variable that is externally defined.\n",
      "If a declaration for an identifier already exists at file scope, any extern declaration of the same identifier found within a block refers to that same object. If no other declaration for the identifier exists at file scope, the identifier has external linkage.\n",
      " \n",
      "56. What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables which are not explicitly initialized?\n",
      "Ans : It depends on complier which may assign any garbage value to a variable if it is not initialized.\n",
      " \n",
      "57. What is the difference between char a[] = “string”; and char *p = “string”;?\n",
      "Ans : In the first case 6 bytes are allocated to the variable a which is fixed, where as in the second case if *p is assigned to some other value the allocate memory can change.\n",
      "58. What’s the auto keyword good for?\n",
      "Ans : Not much. It declares an object with automatic storage duration. Which means the object will be destroyed at the end of the objects scope. All variables in functions that are not declared as static and not dynamically allocated have automatic storage duration by default.\n",
      "For example\n",
      "int main()\n",
      "{\n",
      "int a; //this is the same as writing “auto int a;”\n",
      "}\n",
      "Local variables occur within a scope; they are “local” to a function. They are often called automatic variables because they automatically come into being when the scope is entered and automatically go away when the scope closes. The keyword auto makes this explicit, but local variables default to auto auto auto auto so it is never necessary to declare something as an auto auto auto auto.\n",
      " \n",
      "59. What is the difference between char a[] = “string”; and char *p = “string”; ?\n",
      "Ans : a[] = “string”;\n",

      "The difference is this:\n",
      "p is pointing to a constant string, you can never safely say\n",

      "however you can always say a[3]=’x';\n",
      "char a[]=”string”; - character array initialization.\n",

      " \n",
      "61. What does extern mean in a function declaration?\n",
      "Ans : It tells the compiler that a variable or a function exists, even if the compiler hasn’t yet seen it in the file currently being compiled. This variable or function may be defined in another file or further down in the current file.\n",
      " \n",
      "62. How do I initialize a pointer to a function?\n",

      " \n",
      "64. Explain the scope resolution operator.\n",
      "Ans : It permits a program to reference an identifier in the global scope that has been hidden by another identifier with the same name in the local scope.\n",

      "Ans : The default member and base-class access specifier are different.\n",
      " \n",
      "66. How many ways are there to initialize an int with a constant?\n",
      "Ans : Two. There are two formats for initializers in C++ as shown in the example that follows. The first format uses the traditional C notation. The second format uses constructor notation.\n",
      "int foo = 123;\n",
      "int bar (123);\n",
      " \n",
      "67. How does throwing and catching exceptions differ from using setjmp and longjmp?\n",
      "Ans : The throw operation calls the destructors for automatic objects instantiated since entry to the try block.\n",
      " \n",
      "68. What is a default constructor?\n",
      "Ans : Default constructor WITH arguments class B { public: B (int m = 0) : n (m) {} int n; }; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { B b; return 0; }\n",
      " \n",

      " \n",
      "70. What is the difference between a copy constructor and an overloaded assignment operator?\n",
      "Ans : An overloaded assignment operator assigns the contents of an existing object to another existing object of the same class.\n",
      " \n",
      "71. When should you use multiple inheritance?\n",
      "Ans : There are three acceptable answers: \"Never,\" \"Rarely,\" and \"When the problem domain cannot be accurately modeled any other way.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "72. Explain the ISA and HASA class relationships. How would you implement each in a class design?\n",
      "Ans : A specialized class \"is\" a specialization of another class and, therefore, has the ISA relationship with the other class. An Employee ISA Person. This relationship is best implemented with inheritance. Employee is derived from Person. A class may have an instance of another class. For example, an employee \"has\" a salary, therefore the Employee class has the HASA relationship with the Salary class. This relationship is best implemented by embedding an object of the Salary class in the Employee class.\n",
      " \n",
      "73. When is a template a better solution than a base class?\n",
      "Ans : When you are designing a generic class to contain or otherwise manage objects of other types, when the format and behavior of those other types are unimportant to their containment or management, and particularly when those other types are unknown (thus, the generosity) to the designer of the container or manager class.\n",
      " \n",
      "74. What is a mutable member?\n",
      "Ans : One that can be modified by the class even when the object of the class or the member function doing the modification is const.\n",
      " \n",
      "75. What is an explicit constructor?\n",
      "Ans : A conversion constructor declared with the explicit keyword. The compiler does not use an explicit constructor to implement an implied conversion of types. It’s purpose is reserved explicitly for construction.\n",
      " \n",
      "76. What is the Standard Template Library (STL)?\n",
      "Ans : A library of container templates approved by the ANSI committee for inclusion in the standard C++ specification. A programmer who then launches into a discussion of the generic programming model, iterators, allocators, algorithms, and such, has a higher than average understanding of the new technology that STL brings to C++ programming.\n",
      " \n",
      "77. Describe run-time type identification.\n",
      "Ans : The ability to determine at run time the type of an object by using the typeid operator or the dynamic cast operator.\n",
      " \n",
      "78. What problem does the namespace feature solve?\n",
      "Ans : Multiple providers of libraries might use common global identifiers causing a name collision when an application tries to link with two or more such libraries. The namespace feature surrounds a library’s external declarations with a unique namespace that eliminates the potential for those collisions.\n",
      "This solution assumes that two library vendors don’t use the same namespace identifier, of course.\n",
      " \n",
      "79. Are there any new intrinsic (built-in) data types?\n",

      "Ans : Template class: A generic definition or a parameterized class not instantiated until the client provides the needed information. It’s jargon for plain templates. \n",
      "Class template: A class template specifies how individual classes can be constructed much like the way class specifies how individual objects can be constructed. It’s jargon for plain classes\n",
      " \n",
      "91.When does a name clash occur? \n",
      "Ans : A name clash occurs when a name is defined in more than one place. For example., two different class libraries could give two different classes the same name. If you try to use many class libraries at  the same time, there is a fair chance that you will be unable to compile or link the program because of name clashes. \n",
      " \n",
      "92.What is a dangling pointer? \n",
      "Ans : A dangling pointer arises when you use the address of an object after its lifetime is over. This may occur in situations like returning addresses of the automatic variables from a function or using the address of the memory block after it is freed.\n",

      " \n",
      "95.What is a Null object? \n",
      "Ans : It is an object of some class whose purpose is to indicate that a real object of that class does not exist. One common use for a null object is a return value from a member function that is supposed to return an object with some specified properties but cannot find such an object.\n",
      " \n",
      "96.What is class invariant? \n",
      "Ans : A class invariant is a condition that defines all valid states for an object. It is a logical condition to ensure the correct working of a class. Class invariants must hold when an object is created, and they  must be preserved under all operations of the class. In particular all class invariants are both preconditions and post-conditions for all operations or member functions of the class. \n",

      "Ans : If two base classes have no overlapping methods or data they are said to be independent of, or orthogonal to each other. Orthogonal in the sense means that two classes operate in different  dimensions and do not interfere with each other in any way. The same derived class may inherit such classes with no difficulty.\n",

Retrieval and generationRAG agentsRAG chainsNext stepsTutorialsLangChainBuild a RAG agent with LangChainCopy pageCopy page\\u200bOverview\\nOne of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG.\\nThis tutorial will show how to build a simple Q&A application over an unstructured text data source. We will demonstrate:\\n\\nA RAG agent that executes searches with a simple tool. This is a good general-purpose implementation.\\nA two-step RAG chain that uses just a single LLM call per query. This is a fast and effective method for simple queries.\\n\\n\\u200bConcepts\\nWe will cover the following concepts:\\n\\n\\nIndexing: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens in a separate process.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval and generation: the actual RAG process, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\\n\\n\\nOnce we’ve indexed our data, we will use an agent as our orchestration framework to implement the retrieval and generation steps.\\nThe indexing portion of this tutorial will largely follow the semantic search tutorial.If your data is already available for search (i.e., you have a function to execute a search), or you’re comfortable with the content from that tutorial, feel free to skip to the section on retrieval and generation\\n\\u200bPreview\\nIn this guide we’ll build an app that answers questions about the website’s content. The specific website we will use is the LLM Powered Autonomous Agents blog post by Lilian Weng, which allows us to ask questions about the contents of the post.\\nWe can create a simple indexing pipeline and RAG chain to do this in ~40 lines of code.

As these applications get more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.

Indexing\\nThis section is an abbreviated version of the content in the semantic search tutorial.If your data is already indexed and available for search (i.e., you have a function to execute a search), or if you’re comfortable with document loaders, embeddings, and vector stores, feel free to skip to the next section on retrieval and generation.\\nIndexing commonly works as follows:\\n\\nLoad: First we need to load our data. This is done with Document Loaders.\\nSplit: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won’t fit in a model’s finite context window.\\nStore: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bLoading documents\\nWe need to first load the blog post contents. We can use DocumentLoaders for this, which are objects that load in data from a source and return a list of Document objects.\\nIn this case we’ll use the WebBaseLoader, which uses urllib to load HTML from web URLs and BeautifulSoup to parse it to text. We can customize the HTML -> text parsing by passing in parameters into the BeautifulSoup parser via bs_kwargs (see BeautifulSoup docs). In this case only HTML tags with class “post-content”, “post-title”, or “post-header” are relevant, so we’ll remove all others.\\nCopyimport bs4\\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\\n\\n# Only keep post title, headers, and content from the full HTML.\\nbs4_strainer = bs4.SoupStrainer(class_=(\"post-title\", \"post-header\", \"post-content\"))\\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\\n    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),\\n    bs_kwargs={\"parse_only\": bs4_strainer},\\n)\\ndocs = loader.load()\\n\\nassert len(docs) == 1\\nprint(f\"Total characters: {len(docs[0].page_content)}\")\\n\\nCopyTotal characters: 43131\\n\\nCopyprint(docs[0].page_content[:500])\\n\\nCopy      LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\n\\nDate: June 23, 2023  |  Estimated Reading Time: 31 min  |  Author: Lilian Weng\\n\\n\\nBuilding agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn\\n\\nGo deeper\\nDocumentLoader: Object that loads data from a source as list of Documents.\\n\\nIntegrations: 160+ integrations to choose from.\\nBaseLoader: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\n\\u200bSplitting documents\\nOur loaded document is over 42k characters which is too long to fit into the context window of many models. Even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, models can struggle to find information in very long inputs.\\nTo handle this we’ll split the Document into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant parts of the blog post at run time.\\nAs in the semantic search tutorial, we use a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which will recursively split the document using common separators like new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.\\nCopyfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n\\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\\n    chunk_size=1000,  # chunk size (characters)\\n    chunk_overlap=200,  # chunk overlap (characters)\\n    add_start_index=True,  # track index in original document\\n)\\nall_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\\n\\nprint(f\"Split blog post into {len(all_splits)} sub-documents.\")\\n\\nCopySplit blog post into 66 sub-documents.\\n\\nGo deeper\\nTextSplitter: Object that splits a list of Document objects into smaller\\nchunks for storage and retrieval.\\n\\nIntegrations\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\n\\u200bStoring documents\\nNow we need to index our 66 text chunks so that we can search over them at runtime. Following the semantic search tutorial, our approach is to embed the contents of each document split and insert these embeddings into a vector store. Given an input query, we can then use vector search to retrieve relevant documents.\\nWe can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the vector store and embeddings model selected at the start of the tutorial.\\nCopydocument_ids = vector_store.add_documents(documents=all_splits)\\n\\nprint(document_ids[:3])\\n\\nCopy[\\'07c18af6-ad58-479a-bfb1-d508033f9c64\\', \\'9000bf8e-1993-446f-8d4d-f4e507ba4b8f\\', \\'ba3b5d14-bed9-4f5f-88be-44c88aedc2e6\\']\\n\\nGo deeper\\nEmbeddings: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings.\\n\\nIntegrations: 30+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nVectorStore: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings.\\n\\nIntegrations: 40+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nThis completes the Indexing portion of the pipeline. At this point we have a query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question.\\n\\u200b2. Retrieval and generation\\nRAG applications commonly work as follows:\\n\\nRetrieve: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.\\nGenerate: A model produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data\\n\\n\\nNow let’s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that takes a user question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and returns an answer.\\nWe will demonstrate:\\n\\nA RAG agent that executes searches with a simple tool. This is a good general-purpose implementation.\\nA two-step RAG chain that uses just a single LLM call per query. This is a fast and effective method for simple queries.\\n\\n\\u200bRAG agents\\nOne formulation of a RAG application is as a simple agent with a tool that retrieves information. We can assemble a minimal RAG agent by implementing a tool that wraps our vector store:\\nCopyfrom langchain.tools import tool\\n\\n@tool(response_format=\"content_and_artifact\")\\ndef retrieve_context(query: str):\\n    \"\"\"Retrieve information to help answer a query.\"\"\"\\n    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2)\\n    serialized = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(\\n        (f\"Source: {doc.metadata}\\\\nContent: {doc.page_content}\")\\n        for doc in retrieved_docs\\n    )\\n    return serialized, retrieved_docs\\n\\nHere we use the tool decorator to configure the tool to attach raw documents as artifacts to each ToolMessage. This will let us access document metadata in our application, separate from the stringified representation that is sent to the model.\\nRetrieval tools are not limited to a single string query argument, as in the above example. You can\\nforce the LLM to specify additional search parameters by adding arguments— for example, a category:Copyfrom typing import Literal\\n\\ndef retrieve_context(query: str, section: Literal[\"beginning\", \"middle\", \"end\"]):\\n\\nGiven our tool, we can construct the agent:\\nCopyfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\\n\\n\\ntools = [retrieve_context]\\n# If desired, specify custom instructions\\nprompt = (\\n    \"You have access to a tool that retrieves context from a blog post. \"\\n    \"Use the tool to help answer user queries.\"\\n)\\nagent = create_agent(model, tools, system_prompt=prompt)\\n\\nLet’s test this out. We construct a question that would typically require an iterative sequence of retrieval steps to answer:\\nCopyquery = (\\n    \"What is the standard method for Task Decomposition?\\\\n\\\\n\"\\n    \"Once you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.\"\\n)\\n\\nfor event in agent.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": query}]},\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n):\\n    event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\nCopy================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nWhat is the standard method for Task Decomposition?\\n\\nOnce you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\nTool Calls:\\n  retrieve_context (call_d6AVxICMPQYwAKj9lgH4E337)\\n Call ID: call_d6AVxICMPQYwAKj9lgH4E337\\n  Args:\\n    query: standard method for Task Decomposition\\n================================= Tool Message =================================\\nName: retrieve_context\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Task decomposition can be done...\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Component One: Planning...\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\nTool Calls:\\n  retrieve_context (call_0dbMOw7266jvETbXWn4JqWpR)\\n Call ID: call_0dbMOw7266jvETbXWn4JqWpR\\n  Args:\\n    query: common extensions of the standard method for Task Decomposition\\n================================= Tool Message =================================\\nName: retrieve_context\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Task decomposition can be done...\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Component One: Planning...\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nThe standard method for Task Decomposition often used is the Chain of Thought (CoT)...\\n\\nNote that the agent:\\n\\nGenerates a query to search for a standard method for task decomposition;\\nReceiving the answer, generates a second query to search for common extensions of it;\\nHaving received all necessary context, answers the question.\\n\\nWe can see the full sequence of steps, along with latency and other metadata, in the LangSmith trace.\\nYou can add a deeper level of control and customization using the LangGraph framework directly— for example, you can add steps to grade document relevance and rewrite search queries. Check out LangGraph’s Agentic RAG tutorial for more advanced formulations.\\n\\u200bRAG chains\\nIn the above agentic RAG formulation we allow the LLM to use its discretion in generating a tool call to help answer user queries. This is a good general-purpose solution, but comes with some trade-offs:\\n✅ Benefits⚠️ DrawbacksSearch only when needed – The LLM can handle greetings, follow-ups, and simple queries without triggering unnecessary searches.Two inference calls – When a search is performed, it requires one call to generate the query and another to produce the final response.Contextual search queries – By treating search as a tool with a query input, the LLM crafts its own queries that incorporate conversational context.Reduced control – The LLM may skip searches when they are actually needed, or issue extra searches when unnecessary.Multiple searches allowed – The LLM can execute several searches in support of a single user query.\\nAnother common approach is a two-step chain, in which we always run a search (potentially using the raw user query) and incorporate the result as context for a single LLM query. This results in a single inference call per query, buying reduced latency at the expense of flexibility.\\nIn this approach we no longer call the model in a loop, but instead make a single pass.\\nWe can implement this chain by removing tools from the agent and instead incorporating the retrieval step into a custom prompt:\\nCopyfrom langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt, ModelRequest\\n\\n@dynamic_prompt\\ndef prompt_with_context(request: ModelRequest) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Inject context into state messages.\"\"\"\\n    last_query = request.state[\"messages\"][-1].text\\n    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(last_query)\\n\\n    docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)\\n\\n    system_message = (\\n        \"You are a helpful assistant. Use the following context in your response:\"\\n        f\"\\\\n\\\\n{docs_content}\"\\n    )\\n\\n    return system_message\\n\\n\\nagent = create_agent(model, tools=[], middleware=[prompt_with_context])\\n\\nLet’s try this out:\\nCopyquery = \"What is task decomposition?\"\\nfor step in agent.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": query}]},\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n):\\n    step[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\nCopy================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nWhat is task decomposition?\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nTask decomposition is...\\n\\nIn the LangSmith trace we can see the retrieved context incorporated into the model prompt.\\nThis is a fast and effective method for simple queries in constrained settings, when we typically do want to run user queries through semantic search to pull additional context.\\nReturning source documentsThe above RAG chain incorporates retrieved context into a single system message for that run.As in the agentic RAG formulation, we sometimes want to include raw source documents in the application state to have access to document metadata. We can do this for the two-step chain case by:\\nAdding a key to the state to store the retrieved documents\\nAdding a new node via a pre-model hook to populate that key (as well as inject the context).\\nCopyfrom typing import Any\\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\\nfrom langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, AgentState\\n\\n\\nclass State(AgentState):\\n    context: list[Document]\\n\\n\\nclass RetrieveDocumentsMiddleware(AgentMiddleware[State]):\\n    state_schema = State\\n\\n    def before_model(self, state: AgentState) -> dict[str, Any] | None:\\n        last_message = state[\"messages\"][-1]\\n        retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(last_message.text)\\n\\n        docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)\\n\\n        augmented_message_content = (\\n            f\"{last_message.text}\\\\n\\\\n\"\\n            \"Use the following context to answer the query:\\\\n\"\\n            f\"{docs_content}\"\\n        )\\n        return {\\n            \"messages\": [last_message.model_copy(update={\"content\": augmented_message_content})],\\n            \"context\": retrieved_docs,\\n        }\\n\\n\\nagent = create_agent(\\n    model,\\n    tools=[],\\n    middleware=[RetrieveDocumentsMiddleware()],\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bNext steps\\nNow that we’ve implemented a simple RAG application via create_agent, we can easily incorporate new features and go deeper:\\n\\nStream tokens and other information for responsive user experiences\\nAdd conversational memory to support multi-turn interactions\\nAdd long-term memory to support memory across conversational threads\\nAdd structured responses\\nDeploy your application with LangSmith Deployment\\n\\n\\nEdit this page on GitHub or file an issue.\\nConnect these docs to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.Was this page helpful?YesNoBuild a semantic search engine with LangChainPreviousBuild a SQL agentNextDocs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesForumChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyHomeAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by\\n')]\n"
